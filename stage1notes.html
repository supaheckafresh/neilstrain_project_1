	 			<h1>Lesson 1: The Basics of the Web and HTML</h1>
				<div>
		 		 <h2>What is the Internet?</h2>
					<p>The internet is a vast collection of webpages (in the tens-of-billions),
					which are text documents most commonly of type HTML, interconnected via &quot;hyperlinks.&quot;</p>
				</div>
				<div>
				  <h2>How Does it Work?</h2>
					 <p>To describe the internet in very broad terms: a <em>web browser</em> (a computer program
						for viewing webpages) requests an HTML file contained on the <em>web</em> (essentially the 
						entirety of all servers and computers connected to the internet), via a protocol
						called <em>HTTP</em> (Hyper Text Transport Protocol), from the <em>server</em> (a computer optimized
						for hosting HTML documents and other files) on which the requested HTML file resides.
						The server in turn responds by sending the requested HTML file, also via HTTP and the
						web, to the web browser.</p>
				</div>
				<div>
				  <h2>What is HTML?</h2>
						<p>HTML, short for &quot;Hyper Text Markup Language,&quot; is a filetype as well as a computer
						programming language containing text, and &quot;markups&quot; which web browser applications
						interpret as instructions for how to display content. For example, if a certain text
						phrase will appear in bold type, or where in the browser window to display a block of
						text. HTML documents may also contain references to other files like images and videos,
						as well as references to other HTML webpages, referred to as links or &quot;hyperlinks.&quot;
						Links may in fact refer not only to other HTML files, but also to files of any other
						type.</p>
				</div>
			 	<div>
				  <h2>What are HTML Markups?</h2>
						<p>HTML markups include tags, tag attributes, and container elements.</p>
				  <blockquote>
					 <div>
						<h3>Tags</h3>
							 <p>Some examples of tags are &lt;b> (<b>bold</b>), &lt;em> (<i>emphasis:  italics</i>),
							 &lt;br> (line break), and &lt;p> (paragraph). Certain tags are intended for altering
							 font characteristics or formatting text; in such cases, an opening tag &lt;TAG> and a
							 closing  tag &lt;/TAG>  will encapsulate the text content to which such font and
							 formatting constraints should be applied. Another example of a tag which alters the
							 properties of enclosed text is the &lt;a> (anchor) tag, which adds to text a &quot;hyperlink&quot;
							 referring to another HTML file or other document. Text content contained within an
							 anchor element becomes &quot;clickable&quot; when displayed by a web browser -- when that text
							 is selected or left-clicked by a mouse, the web browser in turn will attempt to display
							 the webpage or other file referenced by the hyperlink.</p>
					 </div>
					 <div>
						<h3>Void Tags</h3>
							 <p>In cases where tags are intended for a use other than altering font or  formatting
							 properties of any proceeding text content, as is the  case with the &lt;img> (image)
							 and &lt;br> (line break) tags, a closing  tag may be unnecessary -- tags of this sort
							 are called &quot;void tags.&quot;</p>
					 </div>
					 <div>
						<h3>Elements</h3>
							 <p>An &quot;element&quot; refers to the HTML structure encompassing an opening tag, as well as
							 any enclosed content and a closing tag (unless these two components are unnecessary,
							 as with void tags). It should be noted that an element may contain any number of
							 interior nested elements (i.e. &quot;nested tags&quot;).</p>
					 </div>
					 <div>
						<h3>Attributes</h3>
							 <p>A programmer may be able to further specify the properties and behaviors of certain
							 tags via their attributes, as is true with the anchor tag:</p> 
								  <blockquote>&lt;a href:&quot;www.google.com&quot;>click here to go to Google.com&lt;/a>
								  </blockquote>
							 <p>Where &quot;href:&quot; is an attribute of the anchor tag, and &quot;www.google.com&quot; is the specified value of that attribute.</p>
					 </div>
					 <div>
						<h3>Container Elements</h3>
							 <p>Container elements, which include &lt;span> and &lt;div> can be used as containers
							 for text or other HTML content, which may also affect how the contained content will
							 display in a web browser.</p>
						<h3>Inline and Block Elements</h3>
							 <p>Both tags and container elements are categorized as either &quot;inline&quot; or &quot;block,&quot;
							 describing their behavior either as affecting HTML content only within a single line
							 (&quot;inline&quot;), or as effectively creating an &quot;invisible box&quot; (whose height and width may be
							 defined) around the content enclosed within the opening and closing tags (&quot;block&quot;).
							 Inline elements include &lt;b>, &lt;em>, &lt;img>, &lt;br>, and &lt;span>. Block elements
							 include &lt;p> and &lt;div>.</p>
					 </div>

			 <h1>Lesson 2: Creating a Structured Document with HTML</h1>
				<div>
				  <h2>What is CSS?</h2>
						<p>CSS, short for &quot;Cascading Style Sheet,&quot; is a programming language, complete with it&apos;s own
						syntax and rules, which is intended for controlling the visual style of a webpage. A CSS
						document may contain style parameters like font-size, font-color, border-width, background
						images, etc.</p>
						<p>CSS is a powerful tool: one can simply change the CSS for a webpage and dramatically alter
						the way that page looks, without ever touching the HTML code.</p>
				</div>
				<div>
				  <h2>How does CSS work with HTML?</h2>
						<p>By assigning class names to an HTML element (i.e. within an opening HTML tag, by adding
						the attribute &quot;class&quot; with an appropriate class name as its value) a web browser is provided
						with instructions for which CSS styles to use for that element. The value (the class name)
						of the class attribute on the HTML document refers to a CSS class of the same name located on
						a separate CSS document.</p>
						<p>House Analogy for a Webpage:</p>
						<blockquote>HTML - structure of the house, layout of the rooms.<br>
						CSS - decorations, window blinds, molding, wall colors.<br>
						Javascript - interactive elements like garage door opener, air conditioner, doorbell.
						</blockquote>
				</div>
				<div>
				  <h2>The DOM - a Rudimentary Introduction</h2>
						<p>DOM, short for &quot;Document Object Model,&quot; is a standard convention which specifies how web
						browsers should translate the elements in an HTML text document into elements in a tree-like
						structure. The HTML structure displayed in Chrome Developer Tools is in essence a visual
						representation (in a form closely resembling an HTML document) of the DOM for a webpage.</p>
						<p>I read elsewhere, including on the W3C (World Wide Web Consortium) website, that the DOM
						is an &quot;API&quot; (Application Programming Interface) -- if I understand correctly, the DOM can be
						thought of as a set of rules (in the form of a piece of code that a web browser understands)
						defining what web browser applications should do with HTML files.</p>
						<p>The tree-like relationship of a page&apos;s HTML elements, or in other words the DOM of that
						page, can also represented as a block diagram:</p>
						<div class="graphic">
							<img src="blockdiagram.JPG" alt="block diagram">
						</div>
				</div>
				<div>
				  <h2>Getting More Familiar with HTML and CSS</h2>
					 <blockquote> 
						<div>
						  <h3>Visualizing Code - Slicing Up an Existing Webpage</h3>
							 <p>It can be a useful exercise for a web developer to analyze the structure of an
							 existing webpage by drawing rectangles, or &quot;boxes,&quot; around all of the page&apos;s visible
							 contents. To go about this process in a more tactile way, one could even print the page
							 and cut out the boxes with scissors.</p>
							 <p>The process is straightforward and should start with identifying the largest boxes,
							 i.e. the largest box representing the entire page, and secondary boxes representing grouped
							 elements: for instance, one might draw a single box around separate images that all appear
							 to be aligned on a horizontal plane. Continue the process by whittling down to smaller and
							 smaller boxes.</p>
							 <p>Going through this effort can give a programmer a general sense for what the HTML code
							 for a page might look like (especially in terms of the structure of &lt;div> and &lt;img> elements,
							 visible contents, and some CSS parameters). This also seems like it would be a very practical
							 method for getting started on coding a new webpage from a graphical mockup.</p>
						</div>
						<div>
						  <h3>Visualizing a Webpage - Exploring Chrome Developer Tools</h3>
							 <p>Chrome Developer Tools allows users to view HTML, CSS and Javascript code for any webpage 
							 (so far as I can tell), in split-screen format alongside or underneath the visible page. 
							 It should be noted that that the code displayed is not the actual code for the page, but 
							 the tree-like HTML structure of the page as Chrome interprets it (although it seems to me 
							 it could be very similar to the original code in many cases).</p>
							 <p>A couple of important points a programmer should consider when exploring the inner-workings 
							 of a page in this way:</p>
								<blockquote>
								  <p>1. Not all of the elements in the HTML structure are visible on the page. Like the 
								  &lt;head> element, for example.</p>
								  <p>2. All of the elements are rectangular: &quot;everything on the web is boxes.&quot; This becomes 
								  apparent when one mouses-over a &lt;div> element in the HTML tree, the related element 
								  on the page immediately gets a rectangular highlight.</p>
								  <p>3. All of the text that is visible on the page can also be found in the HTML tree if 
								  one digs deep enough. This is done by clicking on the triangle icons to display hidden 
								  branches of the structure (and in many cases additional triangle icons indicating 
								  more branches yet).</p>
								</blockquote>
							 <p>In addition to providing insight into the HTML structure of a page, Developer Tools also allows 
							 users to view CSS Styles for that page, including the ability to change attribute values and
							 immediately see the results in the page frame.</p>
						</div>
					 </blockquote>
				</div>
				<div>
				  <h2>Use a Source Code Editor</h2>
						<p>Although HTML and CSS are in fact plain text files which can be created and edited with a simple 
						text editor like Windows Notepad, it is generally recommended that programmers use text editors 
						specifically designed for computer programming. The code editor recommended in this course is 
						Sublime Text 2, which features automatic coloration of different HTML components like tags and 
						text content, as well as other visual aids like line numbers and indent guides. Using a code editor 
						with such features can assist a programmer in writing programs which are both clean and 
						comprehensible.</p>

		  	<h1>Lesson 3: Adding CSS Style to HTML Structure</h1>
		  		<div>
		  			<h2>Avoiding Repetition</h2>
		  				<p>CSS stands for &quot;Cascading Style Sheets.&quot; It is a programming language which allows programmers 
		  					to avoid repetitive code, in large part through the use of classes. When several elements in an 
		  					HTML document given the same class name, a single block of CSS code can apply to that entire group 
		  					of elements. In this way, those elements will appear similarly-styled when displayed by a browser. 
		  					In addition to classes, CSS rules can also be applied to standard HTML tags like &lt;p> and &lt;h1>.</p>
		  		</div>
		  		<div>
		  			<h2>&quot;Cascading&quot; and Inheritance</h2>
		  				<p>To describe what the &quot;Cascading&quot; in CSS means: CSS rules which apply to a specified element 
		  					(ancestor) will &quot;cascade&quot; down (imagine a waterfall) and apply to nested elements (descendants), unless more specific CSS rules are defined for those nested elements. To think of this in a slightly different way: the more 
		  					specific the CSS rule, the higher the precedence. The &quot;cascading&quot; behavior of CSS is yet another way 
		  					in which the language reduces repetitive code, promotes faster page-loading, and lower development 
		  					costs.</p>
		  					<p>This ancestor-descendent behavior is also referred to as &quot;Inheritance.&quot; Inheritance generally 
		  						applies to text-related properties, but not to box-related properties.</p>
		  					<p>In addition to Inheritance, web browsers will also give precedence to CSS style rules in the 
		  						following order with inline style code receiving the highest priority:</p>
		  						<blockquote>1. Browser default style sheet<br>
		  						2. External style sheet<br>
		  						3. Internal style sheet<br>
		  						4. Inline style code
		  						</blockquote>
		  					<p>Regarding browser default styles: there are currently many differences in the default styles of 
		  						the most popular web browsers, which obviously is a dilemma for web developers. There is a push 
		  						within the programming community to rectify this situation by introducing a universal default 
		  						style sheet.</p>
		  		</div>
		  		<div>
		  			<h2>Where to Write CSS Code</h2>
		  				<p>When possible, a programmer should create an external CSS document in the same directory as its 
		  					related HTML documents (or perhaps in another directory which can be accessed by the browser). Any 
		  					HTML documents which will use the external CSS file should contain a &lt;link> tag with the CSS filename 
		  					(the &lt;link> tag should be nested inside of the &lt;head> element) ; this instructs the browser on where 
		  					to find the external document containing all of the needed CSS code. This approach lends itself to 
		  					clearer HTML code, and makes future style adjustments fairly easy.</p>
		  				<p>Alternatives to the above approach are internal style sheets (within the &lt;head> of the HTML document),
		  				 	and inline style (by way of nesting CSS code within a &lt;style> element). However, these methods should 
		  				 	generally be avoided as they don’t offer as much benefit in terms of eliminating repetition compared with 
		  				 	using external style sheets.</p>
		  		</div>
		  		<div>
		  			<h2>CSS Syntax Features</h2>
		  				<p>Selectors specify which HTML elements on a page styles will be applied to. Examples could be a standard 
		  					HTML tag like &lt;p> or a user defined class name, in the form &quot;.descriptive_name&quot;</p>
		  				<p><em>Properties</em> are the stylistic (visual) attributes for which a <em>value</em> or rule can be declared. CSS 
		  					property examples are &quot;font-weight&quot; and &quot;background-color,&quot; among what appear to be at least a couple hundred others. A property-value pair form a <em>declaration</em>.</p>
		  				<p>An important note for those programming in CSS (and in other languages): it is impossible and unnecessary 
		  					to get wrapped up in memorizing all of the properties and possible values that make up the language before 
		  					attempting to use it -- one should go ahead with programming in CSS and get comfortable with frequenting 
		  					online documentation as needed. The CSS reference linked in this lesson:
		  				<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Reference">https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Reference</a>
		  				</p>
		  		</div>
		  		<div>
		  			<h2>HTML Semantics</h2>
		  				<p>It is best to use HTML tags which are semantically appropriate for the content contained within that
		  				 	element. That is to say, whenever possible, the chosen tag should have an intended use which is related
		  				 	to the content type -- like using &lt;p> for a paragraph of text, or &lt;h1> for a title, for instance.</p>
		  		</div>
		  		<div>
		  			<h2>The Box Model</h2>
		  				<p>The Box Model, which as far as I can tell applies to basically every HTML element, block and inline 
		  				  alike, consists of four concentric rectangles:</p>
		  				  <blockquote>1. In the center is the <em>content</em> area, generally used for text, images, or other 
		  				  	contents which appear on the webpage.<br>
		  				  	2. Surrounding the content, is the <em>padding</em> rectangle, which clears an area directly around the 
		  				  	content and is affected by the background-color or background-image of the box.<br>
		  				  	3. The <em>border</em> is the rectangular area which surrounds the content and padding.<br>
		  				  	4. The <em>margin</em> clears a transparent area around the border. The margin can be thought of as the 
		  				  	space between boxes.
		  				  </blockquote>
		  				<p>The total width an HTML box element will occupy on the screen is equal to the sum of the content, 
		  					padding, and border widths; consequently, always having to keep the other two components in mind when 
		  					making changes to one makes planning a page layout more challenging for developers.</p>
		  				<p>The relatively recent CSS rule &quot;border-sizing: border-box&quot; makes the calculation of element size much 
		  					easier, by including the border and pattern sizes, which makes it easier to layout boxes on the page. Just 
		  					set the size of the overall box.</p>
		  				<p>Box sizes can be set to a fixed number of pixels, or a percentage (in the case that they should automatically
		  				 resize based on the size of the browser window); in the case of percentage sizes, boxes are often given a 
		  				 max-width attribute so that they can expand only up to a certain pixel width.</p>
		  		</div>
		  		<div>
		  			<h2>Positioning Boxes</h2>
		  				<p>A good technique for distributing boxes horizontally within a &lt;div> is to use the CSS Flexbox Layout 
		  					module, most simply by adding the rule &quot;display: flex&quot; to a style sheet. For this method to work properly, 
		  					the child elements need to be given a width smaller than the default 100% (via the &quot;max-width&quot; 
		  					CSS property). Flexbox can be used in this way to override the default vertical-based behavior of divs, where nested divs are typically laid out one on top of the other. Flexbox appears to offer an abundance of features for 
		  					distributing, automatically resizing, and wrapping child elements within a container element in any number 
		  					of ways (it&apos;s not just for distributing and aligning horizontally, as was demonstrated in the lesson).</p>
		  		</div>
		  		<div>
		  			<h2>Browser Prefixes</h2>
		  				<p>For some newer CSS properties like flexbox and &quot;border-sizing: border-box&quot; to work in certain browsers, it 
		  					may be necessary to include what is called a &quot;browser prefix&quot; in the related CSS style declaration block which tells the browser to add support for that property. For example, flexbox is fully implemented and works by 
		  					default in newer versions of Chrome and Firefox, but to get the feature to work in Safari one should add the 
		  					following prefix to their CSS: &quot;display: -webkit-flex;&quot;.</p>
		  		</div>
		  		<div>
		  			<h2>Code, Test, Refine</h2>
		  				<p>Work from big to small: when working from a design mock or some other form of instruction for coding a 
		  					webpage, begin by identifying the boxes, then identify similar styles and semantic elements. Likewise, when 
		  					beginning to code the page, start with the general layout of boxes (HTML) and then apply styles (CSS), 
		  					fine-tuning from the biggest (or most general) style properties (like background-color, major box positioning 
		  					adjustments, and title text) to smaller-and-smaller details (perhaps font-family, drop-shadow). By reviewing 
		  					the updated page in a browser along the way, continue to fix things and fine-tune until the page styling 
		  					appears as desired.</p>
		  				<p>In addition to viewing the updated page in a browser, Chrome Dev Tools allows a developer to test different 
		  					attributes and values prior to updating the actual code.</p>
		  		</div>
		  		<div>
		  			<h2>Validate Your Code</h2>
		  				<p>It&apos;s important to verify HTML and CSS in order to make sure that it is error-free and that it complies 
		  					with browser standards.</p>
		  					<blockquote>To verify HTML: <a href="http://validator.w3.org/#validate_by_input">http://validator.w3.org/#validate_by_input</a><br>
